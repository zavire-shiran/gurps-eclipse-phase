# Modeling the ego/morph distinction in GURPS

## Switching Morphs

Each morph is represented as a template. When your character switches
morphs, replace the existing morph template (if any) with the new
template. You may want to structure your character sheet so that if it
is easy to slot in new numbers.

## Prohibited Ego (Dis-)Advantages

An ego cannot have any (dis-)advantages that interact with the
external world, since all of these are determined by the bioware or
hardware installed in your morph. These include any sense modifying
advantages (Acute/Dull/Discriminatory/Scanning senses), physical
attacks (Innate Attack, Claws, Strikers, etc), appearance, movement
abilities, etc.

However, this is not the same as only mental abilities. Egos can have
(for example) ST, DX, HT, Speed, and Basic Move increases
(representing more efficient or skillful manipulation of the morphs
capabilities), with ST, HT, Speed, and Basic Move limited to +/-1 (or
maybe 2 in exceptional circumstances) because there is only so far you
can stretch or mismanage the abilities of a morph. You might even
justify some advantages like Recovery.

# Advantage Shorthands

* __Access Jack__: Telecommunication(Cable Jack, Sensie +80%) [9]

  it is the same advantage as Access Jack. the difference is mostly
